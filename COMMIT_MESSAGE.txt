Add HMMER and PROSITE support for protein domain and motif analysis

Added tools and workflows for protein functional annotation to complement
BLAST results with domain and motif information.

## What These Tools Do:

HMMER (Pfam database):
- Identifies protein domains and families using profile HMMs
- More sensitive than BLAST for detecting distant homologs
- Classifies proteins into functional families (e.g., P450, terpene synthase)
- Provides domain architecture information

PROSITE:
- Identifies short functional motifs and signatures
- Detects active sites, binding sites, and PTM sites
- Uses pattern matching for highly specific features
- Complementary to HMMER's broader domain detection

## Changes Made:

### Environment Management:
- Updated environment.yml to include hmmer and emboss packages
- Ensures reproducible environment setup across systems

### Database Download Scripts:
- Created download_protein_databases.sbatch
  - Downloads Pfam-A database (~600 MB) for HMMER
  - Downloads PROSITE database (~30 MB) for motif scanning
  - Automatically indexes Pfam with hmmpress
  - Includes tool availability checking before download

### Analysis Scripts:
- Fixed run_hmmer.sbatch (corrected OUTDIR variable bug)
- Created run_prosite.sbatch for PROSITE motif scanning
- Both scripts handle multiple species (DC, DG, MF)
- Process protein FASTA files from translation pipeline

### Documentation:
- HMMER_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md: Quick start guide
- UPDATE_ENVIRONMENT.md: Environment update instructions
- SAFE_ENVIRONMENT_UPDATE.md: Queue safety considerations
- QUICK_UPDATE_DECISION.md: Decision tree for updates
- README_PROTEIN_TOOLS.md: Organization and best practices
- ReadME/HMMER_PROSITE_GUIDE.md: Comprehensive usage guide

### Workflow Integration:
Database download script validates required tools before running to
prevent wasted compute time if dependencies are missing.

## Usage:

# Update environment to install HMMER and EMBOSS
conda activate rnaseq
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune

# Download Pfam and PROSITE databases
sbatch scripts/download_protein_databases.sbatch

# Run domain analysis
sbatch scripts/run_hmmer.sbatch DC all_genes_protein.fasta

# (Optional) Run motif analysis
sbatch scripts/run_prosite.sbatch DC all_genes_protein.fasta

## Why This Matters:

Combining BLAST + HMMER + PROSITE provides comprehensive functional
annotation:
- BLAST: Identifies similar proteins (sequence homology)
- HMMER: Identifies protein families and domains (functional units)
- PROSITE: Identifies specific functional motifs (active sites)

This multi-layered approach improves candidate gene prioritization and
functional characterization in the RNA-seq pipeline.
